# Data:
the data derived from yahoo finance importing it from yfinance library 

# Objectives

2. ratios are coming from yahoo finance 
3. plotting the whole history of the stock in order to know their highest peak and lowest trough
4. when a stock splits happened and if the company issue dividends

# Files 
1. python file does the fundemental analysis and gets ratio analysis for a particular stock
2. R file is an app for forecasting 

# Updates 
there will be a monthly-basis update for the code to ensure everything is running properly

# Referencing
1. Most of the prediction code comes from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCjmbLoQahs&t=217s. however i have rewritten the user interface while maintaing the same style and i have fixed the forecast function and plotting in the server part.
